#event1
<npc=23, part=1>
I would like to talk to Talena after we save the town and meet her there. She could surely tell us lots of interesting things!
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=2>
I wouldn't mind listening to a couple of fairy tales either. Although, normally I would do it in a tavern, when a traveling bard comes by...
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=3>
I can even fall asleep right at the table if he's really gifted!
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=2>
Oh, those tales! Oh, those storytellers! I was once really embarrassed when one of those bards walked into a tavern and started his tales... 
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=3>
He was so smooth that I fell asleep without even noticing it. Very embarrassing.
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=2>
Well, that could be the case. However, most professional storytellers, commonly met in taverns, only succeed in inducing sleep.
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=3>
To their credit, sleeping to their tales is very relaxing!
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=2>
What do you want the stories for? It's all just nonsense, baloney and prejudice. Even real events get distorted beyond recognition!
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=3>
Thinking about becoming a character in such a story gives me the shivers.
<npc=23, part=4>
Don't mix up the traveling bards with serious people gathering ancient knowledge! I'm positive that Talena knows something that can help us!
<npc=21, iammale, part=5>
Okay, take it easy! I'm not prejudiced against Talena. I'd just be happy if she really tells us something useful.
<npc=21, iamfemale, part=5>
Okay, take it easy! I'm not prejudiced against Talena. I'd just be happy if she really tells us something useful.

<npc=2022, iamfemale, iammage, part=1>
Greetings, colleague! I beg you, help the people of this town if you are strong and good-hearted!
<npc=2022, part=2>
They put their hope in me, but my knowledge of magic is not very useful in battle. It's a shame that I couldn't do anything for them.
<npc=21, iammale, part=3>
You're Talena, aren't you? I heard about you in Kaarg! My friends and I will be glad to help you!
<npc=21, iamfemale, part=3>
You're Talena, aren't you? I heard about you in Kaarg! My friends and I will be glad to help you!
<npc=21, part=4>
Just so you know, the people of the town are not disappointed with you. In fact, they spoke very highly of you.

Greetings, sir Knight! I beg you, help the people of this town if your heart has not yet turned to stone!
<npc=2022, part=2>
They put their hope in me, but my knowledge of magic is not very useful in battle. It's a shame that I couldn't do anything more for them.
<npc=22, part=3>
You are Talena, aren't you? I heard about you in Kaarg! My friends and I will certainly aid you! 
<npc=22, part=4>
To soothe your conscience, know that the people are not disappointed with you. In fact, they spoke very highly of you.

<npc=2022, part=1>
You saved the people! You have earned both my respect and a reward.
<npc=2022, part=2>
I promise that I will repay this debt when we make it to my tower.
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=3>
Come on! You're about as rich as I am orcish. Keep your gold. You'll need it later...
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=3>
What's this debt you're talking about? I wasn't asking for a reward from you!
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=3>
I do not need money as a reward for my assistance. Please keep your money to yourself and use it as you will.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=3>
What debt?! I've probably got more money in my pocket than you've ever seen. Keep it! 
<npc=2022, part=4>
This reward doesn't resemble coinage. My wealth is different...
<npc=2022, part=5>
But we can discuss this later. For now, I must find the amulet that I lost while escaping from the orcs. I can't enter my tower without it!

This is all that's left of the town...The Orcs have no mercy for humans and their houses.
<npc=2022, part=2>
I am afraid that they have carried my amulet to their lair.

This is my amulet. We can go to my tower now!

======Talena talks to the hero

<npc=2022, part=1>
Thank you for your help! In return, I can tell something interesting. I believe that you will not become bored, despite the length of the story.
<npc=2022, part=2>
As you know, I study tales and legends. This has been causing problems with the Kaarg authorities, so I had to move out here to this tower.
<npc=2022, part=3>
It turned out to be blessing. You can learn a lot more about the past in the remote parts of Yases than in the capital...But back to the story. You have heard about the Source of Magic, haven't you?
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=4>
Sure! The Great Mages supposedly used its force before the Cataclysm! But isn't that just a fairy tale?
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=4>
You mean the one that supposedly gave power to Great Mages before the Cataclysm? This was the favorite fairy tale of my granny!
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=4>
Of course! Everyone has heard about the Source of Magic that gave power to the Great Mages before the Cataclysm! I wish I could enter that fairy tale and touch the Source for myself!
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=4>
Certainly! The Great Mages supposedly used its force before the Cataclysm. I wish it weren't a fairy tale...I could use some of this Magic Source myself, right now.
<npc=2022, part=5>
I am convinced that some powerful magical structures built before the Cataclysm still exist. 
<npc=2022, part=6>
The Great Mages have decided to close some of them to prevent their misuse. One such Source must be here on Yases.
<npc=2022, part=7>
I was not the only one who reached this conclusion, but another relevant secret is known only to me. I have found a very old book containing yet another legend about Raminan, the Treasure Island. 
<npc=2022, part=8>
Unlike the Source of Magic, Raminan is a real fairy tale. Everybody tells stories, but no one in his right mind would actually go looking for it. 
<npc=2022, part=9>
The rendition of the legend of Raminan that I found was very similar to all others, with the exception of one thing...
<npc=2022, part=10>
The author mentioned that in some ancient language the word Raminan stands for "place where magic is born" - the Source of Magic!
<npc=2022, part=11>
It turns out that the mystery of the Source of Magic can be solved if both legends are thoroughly researched!
<npc=2022, part=12>
And that would take...well, I'm going to return to Kaarg. The authorities wouldn't care about a legend gatherer these days. We'll finish this conversation there.
