<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=1>
Look, this is great! The Druids will join the Knights in the battle against Urd!
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=1>
Amazing! The Druids will join the Knights! This is fantastic!
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=1>
What a pleasant surprise! So, the Druids have also sent a company to join the Knights in the battle against Urd!!
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=1>
At last the Druids have learned to see things outside of their Woods. It's very nice of them to have decided to join the Knights!
<npc=22, part=2>
This is good news indeed. Now that our forces are joined, our victory is certain!
<npc=2132, part=3>
All right. But I must be sure that the Druids will not defy me in battle. Let them pledge their obedience to me like my warriors do! 
<npc=690, part=4>
You've got quite an attitude, warrior. Would you also require us to demonstrate our submission by kissing your boots?
<npc=690, part=5>
Your attack still echoes in the Ancient Woods. Be thankful that we were merciful enough not to strike back!
<npc=2131, part=6>
Right...you only forced the Dragons and serpents to butcher my soldiers! My husband died in your damn Woods, and you babble on about mercy here!?
<npc=2131, part=7>
What can you possibly know about human feelings?! Your blood must be as green as the leaves you are wrapped in!
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=8>
Friends, let's stop fighting. This is, without a doubt, the worst time to bring up old grudges...
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=8>
Stop this! Are you nuts?!
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=8>
What is going on here? Come back to your senses immediately! This is neither the time nor the place to bring up old hostility!
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=8>
Hey, hey, what's going on? Have you all gone insane?!
<npc=690, part=9>
This woman shall pay dearly for saying that. I am not going to take any insults from a bunch of idiots who've been serving a rotting-zombie corpse for all these years!
<npc=2132, part=10>
And I am sick of listening to a scornful know-it-all who can only hide behind someone else's back. There are no trolls or Dragons here...Let's just see what you're worth in a fair battle!

#event2
<npc=23, part=1>
Great Powers! All of the Druids are dead...What happens next?
<npc=21, part=2>
Nothing good now, I suppose. The war between Kaarg and the Ancient Woods will go on.
<npc=21, part=3>
Also, our campaign against Urd will become more difficult, as there are not many Knights left to join us.
<npc=22, part=4>
Nevertheless, we must adhere to our oath!

<npc=22, part=4>
As sad as it is to admit, much of the blame was theirs. Damn our red-blooded arrogance! 
<npc=22, part=5>
Nevertheless, we must adhere to our oath!

===============Liche dies==============
#event4
<npc=819, part=1>
I am defeated! Finally!
<npc=819, part=2>
I want my executioner to know that I have always hated Urd for trapping me in this "imitation" of life. I killed his enemies and did his bidding, but secretly I always wanted to kill him!
<npc=819, part=3>
Now I'm free. Leaving this existence forever. And Urd won't be able to bring me back again, Uwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!
#
============I, or Igles, scream "love is all you need" to the fighting people
#event5
<npc=21, part=1>
Stop! Stop it now, come back to your senses! We have a common enemy...
<npc=688, part=2>
Our enemy is right here! Remember how we treated you in the Woods, and join us against the Knights!
<npc=2132, part=3>
Igles, why aren't your friends joining with us? Have you decided to betray us? So be it!
<npc=2132, part=4>
Kill the Druids!!!
<npc=690, part=5>
Down with the Knights!!!
#
==========We finally win...===============
#event6
<npc=22, part=1>
Die, Urd! Die, Soul Lord! I have finally fulfilled my oath! Yases is free from Urd's evil rule!!!
<npc=21, iammale, part=2>
And I...I have completed the mission from Skrakan. But what happens now? Urd was a Great Mage after all. His death endangers the whole Allod...
<npc=21, iamfemale, part=2>
And I...I have completed the mission from Skrakan. But what happens now? Urd was a Great Mage after all. His death endangers the whole Allod...
<npc=2000, part=3>
Don't worry, Heroes. Yases is safe.
<npc=21, part=4>
Skrakan? You're here?! But how...
<npc=2000, part=5>
No, I'm still on Uimoir, my friends. You are seeing only my image. I suspected that Urd was the cause of all the problems on the Allod, and I wasn't the only one. Many of the Great Mages were also suspicious of Urd.
<npc=2000, part=6>
We discussed this, and one of us has agreed to part with his most talented apprentice. A new Great Mage will arrive on Yases soon and protect the Allod.
<npc=2000, part=7>
And now, my envoy may return to Uimoir...
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=8>
Isn't it too early? I've lived through so much here that it makes me doubt whether I would ever enjoy a boring life in Plagat!
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=8>
I sort of forgot about it Uimoir... Frankly, it's not time for me to return yet. I'm needed here on Yases. There is still so much left to do!
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=8>
I would prefer to stay here for a while. I've earned a reputation and have found many new friends on Yases...Also, I believe I've finally found my purpose in Yases!
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=8>
Really? I would like to stay here, Skrakan. Here on Yases everybody knows me, loves me, and admires me...I can't leave now!
<npc=2000, part=9>
Well, so be it! I hope that you'll be able to help Igles to end the war between Kaarg and the Druids.
<npc=2000, part=10>
I have only one more thing left to say then...Farewell. And may you live a life full of adventures!
