======Beginning conversation ===========
#event1
<npc=22, part=1>
Here's where my family's land begins. We've had this land for longer than I can recall. We should be completely safe here!

<npc=2110, part=1>
Hey, wait a minute, traveler! Who are you and why are you here?
<NPC=21, iammale, part=2>
You can see who I am, and my business is simple: I accompany my friend Igles who is going to Lyrisha.
<NPC=21, iamfemale, part=2>

We've heard about the young Lord. People say, he is an honorable man. Any friend of his is welcome here.

======Hero and Igles talk to the headman of the upper village
#event4
<npc=2112, part=1>
Good day, Lord Igles!
<npc=22, part=2>
Good day. How are you doing here?
<npc=2112, part=3>
Bad, my lord, bad. The taxes are too high, the harvest is too low, and all of the workers were just drafted! In addition to that, a Dragon came to live nearby not too long ago. I'd better leave quickly.
<npc=22, part=4>
Wait for a while. Things might still change, if I have anything to say about it!
#
======= hero comes to Daustun and talks to the last peasant 
#event5
<NPC=21, iammale, iammage, part=1>
I can't rebuild your houses, but I sure can help the dying.
<NPC=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=1>
So? Do you still think that no one will help a poor peasant?
<npc=2108, IAMMAGE, part=2>
Thank you for your kindness! It is relieving to know that good-hearted people are still around these days!
#
======= hero comes to Daustun and talks to the last peasant 
#event6
<NPC=21, part=1>
The place is devastated! Very professionally too... 
<npc=2108, IAMFIGHTER, part=2>
To you it might make a difference whether it was professional or not. To us, it is all the same; everything is destroyed and no one will help us.
#
=========Igles comes to Daustun and talks to the last peasant.
#event7
<npc=22, part=1>
What's happened here?
<npc=2108, part=2>
Oh, my Lord! A royal draft crew headed by a Necromancer came here. I almost wish we were attacked by outlaws instead! We tried to resist, but that only managed to infuriate them further.
<npc=22, part=3>
I'll make the bastards pay for this outrage! The King's name won't protect them from my wrath, either!

======= Situation: the hero enters Lyrisha from the right, talks to a watchman.========
#event9
<npc=2110, iammale, part=1>
Halt! Who are you?
<npc=2110, iamfemale, part=1>
Halt! Who are you? 
<NPC=21, iammale, part=2>
I am a friend and companion of Lord Igles!
<NPC=21, iamfemale, part=2>
I am a friend and companion of Lord Igles!
<npc=2110, part=3>
Then you are welcome here, whoever you are. The young Lord is very respected in our village and we are happy to see his friends, even though there isn't much happiness around these days.

Then you are welcome here, whoever you are. The young Lord and his family are very respected in our village, as are his friends. How was your trip here? I hope the ogre didn't scare you.
<NPC=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=4>
The trip was good, and it takes more than just an ogre to scare me.
<NPC=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=4>
Me?? Scared by an ogre? I'm the one who does the scaring around here!
<NPC=21, iammale, iammage, part=4>
It was fine, thank you. Regarding the ogre, it has been a long time since one of their kind could scare me.
<NPC=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=4>
Scare? Me? It'll take more than just an ogre to get me shaking!!

=======Situation: the knight comes to Lyrisha and talks to the headman. ========
#event11
<npc=2112, part=1>
Welcome, young Lord!
<npc=22, part=2>
Let's get straight to the business that called me here, shall we? What happened?
<npc=2112, part=3>
Oh, young Lord! Do you know my son, my only beloved son...
<npc=22, part=4>
Of course, I do. What could possibly happen to a huge guy like him? Was he kidnapped?
<npc=2112, part=5>
Worse, my lord. He was drafted! I tried to show them the protection paper you gave us, and told them that my Lord would be enraged...But they only murmured something about "the nobles getting it too," and left.
<npc=22, part=6>
Drafted!!?? Who did this?!
<npc=2112, part=7>
Some soldiers, an officer, and a mage. I grabbed my ax to defend the village but the soldiers beat me up, and then the officer threatened to send in some people to burn down the village.
<npc=2112, part=8>
I told them that I would tell my Lord about them, but they only laughed and then headed to Daustun, far to the west from here.
<npc=22, part=9>
So they laughed, huh? Well, I'm going to join the fun too. Just let me catch up with them! Can you protect yourself from the bandits while I'm gone? Do you have enough weapons and supplies?
<npc=2112, part=10>
Our watchmen have clubs, and we also have hunting bows that we can use.
<npc=22, part=11>
That's not much...I'll do my best to be back here when the bandits arrive. Together we can explain to them that this is OUR land!
#
=============the son comes to Lyrisha.  No check for the hero or Igles.
#event12
<npc=2112, part=1>
My son!!! You are alive! I can't tell how happy I am! And how grateful I am to Lord Igles!
<npc=2112, part=2>
What is it? What's that sound coming from the southern road?
<npc=2109, part=3>
The bandits! The bandits are coming!!!
#
===========After fighting the chastisers=============
#event13
<npc=2112, part=1>
I don't know how to thank you, my Lord! What can I do for you? I would like to give you something, but please keep this a secret.
<npc=2112, part=2>
Everybody's heard about the Three Stars that fell a hundred years ago. But no one knows where they fell. I know, because I found one of them, and I'll give it to you, young Lord Igles.
<npc=2112, part=3>
People say bad things about those Stars, but I think that to find them is good luck rather than a curse.
<npc=22, part=4>
Such a gift should be kept secret indeed! Actually, I thought that falling stars would look a bit different than this. It reminds me of something I saw once...
<npc=22, part=5>
Something very familiar, but what? Oh well, I'll try to recall it when I get back to town.
#
=======Situation: the knight approaches the crew before he learns about it=========
#event14
<npc=691, PART=1>
Get on your way! Trespassers aren't tolerated, whoever they are!
#
======The knight approaches the crew after talking to the headman.===========
#event15
<npc=691, PART=1>
Halt! Stay back! In the name of the King, you may not approach!
<npc=22, PART=2>
My family has served the Kings of Yases for five hundred years, and it is I who will give orders in the name of the King. Release all of the prisoners you illegally captured!
<npc=691, PART=3>
I don't care about law, Knight. Get away from here! Or shall I force you?
<npc=22, PART=4>
You are threatening the master of this land! No matter how much the King favors your Guild, you will not get away with it!
<npc=691, PART=5>
Enough talk. You are impeding an important task of the Guild, and you shall be disciplined!
#
======hero finds crater
#event16
<NPC=21, iamfighter, part=1>
That's quite a hole! If it was made by something that fell, it must have been falling from great height.
<NPC=21, iammage, part=1>
It seems that this crater has some magic aura about it. It's so powerful that I can feel it right now.
#
=====Igles finds the crater
#event17
<npc=22, part=1>
What a strange place! It makes me remember those stories about the Three Stars. It looks like one of them could have fallen here.
