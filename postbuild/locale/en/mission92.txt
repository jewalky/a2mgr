=======Start
#event1
<npc=22, part=1>
I suppose the elf doubts us despite requesting our help.
<npc=22, part=2>
I want to prove to him that some people, aside from the long dead ones, are worth respect!
<npc=23, part=3>
Yes, I have always thought that the elves are sympathetic and intelligent, but this one...He was so arrogant!
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=4>
Oh, shut up! He's just an elf after all. Don't expect too much from him. Besides, he isn't the one that matters.
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=5>
Our main objective is to prevent the Necromancers from using Esgel against us. Let the elf think whatever he wants about us.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=4>
Oh, leave the elf alone...Whatever he thinks about us, it's his personal opinion, which I don't care about.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=5
But I do care about not giving the Necromancers an opportunity to use Esgel against us. Let the elf go to hell for all I care!
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=4>
You are paying too much attention to the elf. His attitude towards us is not the issue.
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=5>
First and foremost, we must prevent the Necromancers from using Esgel against us. The elf may keep his attitude unchanged, whatever it is.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=4>
Should we kneel before the elf the next time we see him? He's not that important!
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=5>
First and foremost, we must prevent the Necromancers from using Esgel against us. Whatever he thinks is his personal business.
<npc=23, iammale, part=6>
You wouldn't dare say that if he were here!
<npc=23, iamfemale, part=6>
You wouldn't dare say that if he were here!
<npc=21, part=7>
Enough! We didn't come here to discuss the elf, all right? Let's get going!

=======Druid ghost shepherd to hero 
#event2
<npc=21, part=1>
I have important business concerning the security of the Ancient Woods, good lady. I must talk to the spirits. Can you make the necessary arrangements for me?
<npc=689, part=2>
It would have been possible if not for the harpies who have recently occupied the village in the northwest.
<npc=689, part=3>
These mindless creatures possess magic and are scaring the spirits badly. I can not guide the spirits while the harpies are around.
<npc=21, part=4>
I got the picture. We'll continue this discussion when the harpies are dead. I'll make sure this doesn't take long!

<npc=21, part=4>
Then I will make sure that the harpies are destroyed, and then come to see you again. Would you be willing to continue this discussion then?
<npc=689, part=5>
Certainly!
#
=======Druid ghost shepherd agrees 
#event5
<npc=689, part=1>
Nothing prevents me from guiding the spirits since the harpies are gone. But I am unable to talk to or understand the spirits.
<npc=689, part=2>
You should make arrangements with the Interpreter from the other village. He is the only one capable of understanding them.

=======Druid interpreter to the hero 
#event6
<npc=21, part=1>
I'm looking for the Interpreter who can talk to the spirits. I require his assistance in a very important matter, essential for the security of the Ancient Woods! 
<npc=688, part=2>
Currently, I'm more worried with the security of my dwelling. A mighty Dragon has recently attacked us, and there is no doubt that it will return.
<npc=688, part=3>
I can't concentrate on talking to the spirits while worrying about my community!
<npc=688, part=4>
I will only be able to help if you destroy the Dragon.

======= Druid interpreter agrees 
#event9
<npc=688, part=1>
So the Dragon's dead? Perfect! I can now talk to the spirits without being distracted. You should find the Ghost Shepherd and have him bring the spirits here.
#
=======Druid interpreter talks to the ghosts (note: the ghost talks using one of the numerous orcish dictionaries from HE's)
#event10
<npc=688, part=1>
Spirit invisible, spirit unsounded! With the power of my magic I give you the ability to speak!
<npc=631, part=2>
Tre gha, ba gamnia! Ber ju um husch...
<npc=688, part=3>
What a mishap! This spirit belongs to a prehistoric orc, who, accordingly, speaks only prehistoric Orcish. I will try to make something out...
<npc=688, part=4>
He seems to be talking about an amulet left on the lakeshore, by an oak tree with three rocks nearby.
