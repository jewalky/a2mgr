The sands of the Orcish lands are deadly! 
#
=======Igles dies========

Ginsush the Orc has died! He could have been very useful in searching for the Star...
#
=======Start conversation=====
#event1
<npc=23, part=1>
The map shows mountains to the north of here and a volcano crater between them. That's what we're looking for. I'll go first, follow me!
<npc=22, part=2>
I don't mind you showing the path, but I am the one who gives orders in this party. The first order to you is stay back. We could be ambushed from anywhere!
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=3>
You sound like a drill sergeant, my friend. I suppose you'll be making Dina do pushups and peel potatoes now!
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=3>
Should Dina be standing at attention, as well? If you're visually challenged, I'll remind you that she is a pretty girl and not one of your stupid draftees. Not that it makes any difference to you, but...
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=3>
I am sorry to say this, dear Igles, but you sound as if you are commanding a boot camp! Perhaps, you have mistaken Dina for one of your draftees?
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=3>
Is that a way to address a pretty girl? Do you talk to all of the ladies you meet like this?
<npc=22, part=4>
Very funny. But while we are in this land, I will ask you to refrain from joking. Otherwise, the Orcs could be the ones who laugh!
#
=======Dina approaches the crater =======
#event2
<npc=23, part=1>
I can't be mistaken! This is the place that was marked in the papers...And here is the crater made by the Fallen Star!
<npc=22, part=2>
But the Star isn't here...there are orcish footprints everywhere. Probably, one of them has the Star. I wish we could find him...
#
=======Bats attack.  Dialogue upon slaughter =====
#event3
<npc=23, part=1>
Repulsive creatures! Back home we had mice living in the basement, and I was afraid of them. Yet a hundred mice are better than one of these flying monsters!
#
=======Conversation with the orc=====
#event4
<NPC=677, part=1>
I do not-not understand this. Who are you, human-human? Why get between us?
<npc=677, part=2>
You saved me now, I thank-thank you, but it does not make-make much sense. The Orcs want to kill-kill me!
#
======Second conversation with the orc (Dina talking) =====
#event5
<npc=23, part=1>
Tell me, why do your kinsmen hate you so much?
<npc=677, part=2>
Huh, I not know. Name's Ginsush, I did not want-want to kill humans for nothing. Told all Orcs that we can live in peace, and Bugur-Shaman told the other way around. For that Bugur-Shaman ordered to kill-kill me.
<npc=23, part=3>
Tell me please, Ginsush...Have you heard anything about the Star that fell in your land? We are looking for it, but can not find it.
<npc=677, part=4>
Everybody here heard-heard about it. Shaman Hosh-Yelooy found-found that Star, and told everyone that the Great Jackal has given him the Stone Eye, wrapped up in gold.
<npc=677, part=5>
This stone now hangs on Hosh-Yelooy's neck, and Yelooy-shaman is now the boss in Brown Beetle Sands.
<npc=23, part=6>
An unpleasant name...Where are those sands, can we get there?
<npc=677, part=7>
Sure you can get there. Not sure if you can get out-out of there.
<npc=677, part=8>
If you really need-need that, I show you the way. Then I not know where to go-go. Here the Orcs will kill me, in the Plains the soldiers will kill me, in the Woods-Woods the Druids will kill me...
<npc=23, part=9>
I don't think that the Druids will harm you at all. They wouldn't mind you staying, so long as you behave yourself. Try going to the Woods, we may see you there later.

=======Igles doesn't like the oasis and says so =====
#event6
<npc=22, part=1>
The burning heat in the desert attracts many enemies, and now suddenly a swamp appears right in the middle...this is a dangerous combination. All sorts of nasty creatures may dwell here!
