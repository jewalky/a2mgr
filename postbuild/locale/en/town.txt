#tips1
After completing a mission you may return to the town. In the town there is a Shop where you can buy and sell items and armor, and an Inn where you can hire mercenaries and receive new missions. You can also enter the Game Menu at any time by pressing the <ESC> key or by clicking on the big statue in the town.
#tips2
You can see the Inn patrons in the bottom of the screen. Mercenaries are displayed on a greenish gray background. You can see their portraits and stats in the left part of the screen. Press the <Hire> button if you wish him/her to accompany you in the next mission. Click on <Talk> to hear his/her story. Other characters are displayed on a light green background and will give you your missions.
#tips3
You are in the Shop. Click on any shelf to see its contents. You can then drag any item onto the table, and click the <Buy> or <Sell> buttons to do the appropriate action.
#tips4
You can scroll between your characters in the bottom right window by using the golden arrows. To pass items between your characters, drag any item on the table, then scroll to the character you want and take it back from the table again.
#tips5
This screen allows you to create your own character. If you are playing for the first time, you may skip it by clicking <Accept>. If you want to adjust the stats, you can start with changing your character's alignment by selecting one of the five weapons classes. This will give you an initial skill of 20 for that weapon type.
#tips6
This screen allows you to create your own character. If you are playing for the first time, you may skip it by clicking <Accept>. If you want to adjust the stats, you can start with changing your character's alignment by selecting one of the five element spheres. This will give you an initial skill of 20 for that element. The starting set of spells will not be affected.
#tips7
Now you can change the basic stats of your character if you don't like them. When you decrease one of the attributes you get "points" that can be used to increase the other attributes. You can view your current stats in the bottom-left window. Click on <Accept> when you're done.
#tips8
Select the class and the sex of your character by clicking on the appropriate portrait.
#tips9
Now select whatever game difficulty level you choose. If you are playing for the first time, select the "easy" level.
#tips10
If you don't like the name of your character, change it now.
#tips11
This is a secluded place in the Ancient Woods where the Druid Shop and Inn are located. There is no gate and no fence, so it is easy to leave: just click on the westbound trail near the edge of the screen.
#tips12
This is Kaarg, the capital of the Allod of Yases. Here you can visit the Inn or the Shop.  Click on the King's statue to enter the Main Menu. You can also talk to the locals by clicking on them. To start a mission, click on the town gate to exit to the map.

=====Mission 10 "Skrakan's trial"  given ==========
#npc207talk9
<NPC=207, part=1>
I have heard rumors that Skrakan is looking for an envoy, but this is none of my concern. Although war is my trade, I prefer fighting in familiar places, not in distant lands I've never heard of before.
#npc2108talk8
<NPC=2108, part=1>
Great Mage Skrakan is the wisest man on the Allod. People say that he is looking for an envoy. I can't understand why anyone would take on such a dangerous mission, no matter how big the reward would be.
<NPC=2108, part=2>
Our craft is buy cheap, sell high. Let someone else get his butt into trouble. I'm staying right here where it's safe and profitable!
#npc520talk7
<NPC=520, part=1>
It is a great honor and an even greater glory to become the Great Mage's envoy! Many people have tried to gain the good graces of the Great Mage and have failed. 
<NPC=520, part=2>
As for me, I'm quite satisfied with my current rank and status. I don't have a burning need to get myself killed just yet!
#npc517talk10
<NPC=517, PART=1>
I was the one who brought to town the news that Lord Skrakan seeks an envoy. He thought that many adventurers would strive for this rare honor.
<NPC=517, PART=2>
But dusk has fallen, and no one yet has dared to face Lord Skrakan and find out what he has planned.
<NPC=21, PART=3>
Don't you know what the Great Mage is planning?
<NPC=517, PART=4>
I'm just Lord Skrakan's messenger. I don't know the first thing about what he'll convey to the envoy, whoever that is. I can only give you directions to his Tower of Rakhl-Uimoir.
<NPC=21, IAMMALE, IAMFIGHTER, PART=5>
So no one has dared to go there yet? Looks like I'll be the first, then!
<NPC=517, IAMMALE, IAMFIGHTER,PART=6>
I must warn you that the way to Skrakan's Tower is not safe. Many dangerous and repulsive creatures dwell along the route to the Tower. You may die just trying to get there!
<NPC=21, IAMMALE, IAMFIGHTER, PART=7>
Just between you and me, I'm already dying of boredom in this town. Look, it's my duty as a Knight to sample as much peril as I can, but Plagat is so dreary, so monotonous, and so...safe. There's nothing for me to do here!
<NPC=21, IAMMALE, IAMFIGHTER, PART=8>
To pass up an opportunity like this would be foolhardy and stupid. I'm ready to visit Skrakan's tower right now!
<NPC=21, IAMFEMALE, IAMFIGHTER, PART=5>
So, no one has dared to visit him yet? That's not surprising in this town! The locals here have as much bravado as a whipped puppy. I wouldn't bet on them surviving a walk across the street, let alone a Great Mage's mission!
<NPC=517, IAMFEMALE, IAMFIGHTER,PART=6>
What's that supposed to mean? Are you saying that you are going to hear what the Great Mage has to say?
<NPC=21, IAMFEMALE, IAMFIGHTER, PART=7>
I'd be delighted to hear what the Great Skrakan has to say, if he doesn't mind talking with a woman. I've been looking for some real adventure for quite some time!
<NPC=517, IAMFEMALE, IAMFIGHTER, PART=8>
I must warn you that the way to Skrakan's Tower is not safe. Many dangerous and repulsive creatures dwell along the route to the Tower. You may die just trying to get there!
<NPC=21, IAMFEMALE, IAMFIGHTER, PART=9>
Be that as it may. It's better that dying a slow death here in Plagat. Plus, if I hear that "bunny" story from that Innkeeper one more time, I fear I'll go berserk and rampage through the town!
<NPC=21, IAMMALE, IAMMAGE, PART=5>
Perhaps people are just unwilling to commit without sufficient knowledge of the nature of the mission and the risks involved...or of the reward offered by Skrakan for completing his mission.
<NPC=517, IAMMALE, IAMMAGE,PART=6>
I know not about the reward, but it must be generous. Skrakan must have amassed a small fortune by now. I'm sure he'd be willing to pay handsomely, if the mission is dangerous enough.
<NPC=21, IAMMALE, IAMMAGE, PART=7>
Indeed. Hmmm...a very, very tempting proposal...It would be a great privilege to converse with Lord Skrakan. He could teach me much. I'm ready to depart immediately. Show me the way.
<NPC=517, IAMMALE, iammage, PART=8>
I must warn you that the way to Skrakan's Tower is not safe. Many dangerous and repulsive creatures dwell along the route to the Tower. You may die just trying to get there!
<NPC=21, IAMMALE, IAMMAGE, PART=9>
Yes, this sounds dangerous, I admit. But my decision remains unchanged. I will hear what the Great Mage has to say.
<NPC=517, IAMMALE, IAMMAGE,PART=10>
But why? You don't look like the adventuring type! And you don't exactly look like you need the money to me...
<NPC=21, IAMMALE, IAMMAGE, PART=11>
You see, dear girl, I am just using common sense. There is no way I am going to develop my professional skills by staying here in Plagat. There is not much call for a Battle Mage when there are no battles!
<NPC=21, IAMMALE, IAMMAGE, PART=12>
However, should I serve Lord Skrakan well: my status will most certainly be elevated, and that is well worth the risk!
<NPC=21, IAMFEMALE, IAMMAGE, PART=5 >
Why don't you go see the Great Mage yourself? That would've saved you a lot of time that you've spent talking to me in this tavern!
<NPC=517, IAMFEMALE, IAMMAGE, PART=6>
I would, but I am too young and just too inexperienced, I'm afraid. Lord Skrakan needs someone more skilled and distinguished than I. 
<NPC=21, IAMFEMALE, IAMMAGE, PART=7 >
So you just chickened out, is that it? Well, I'm not so shy. I'll go to Skrakan's tower today. I just hope he approves my request to assist him.
<NPC=517, IAMFEMALE, IAMmage,PART=8>
I must warn you that the way to Skrakan's Tower is not safe. Many dangerous and repulsive creatures dwell along the route to the Tower. You may die just trying to get there!
<NPC=21, IAMFEMALE, IAMMAGE, PART=9>
Are you trying to scare me now? If so, save that for someone else. You were looking for an envoy, and you have found one! Now, lead the way!

Sorry, but you can't leave the town. Only those with urgent assignments may pass. I'd suggest visiting the Inn and talking to the people you meet. I'm sure that someone will be able to help you out...

=====woman with a jar in Kaarg=====
#kaargwoman30
<npc=90, iammale, iamfighter, part=1>
Take a look at the handsome guy here, sis. He sure is the brawny type. Must be a hot shot! 
<npc=99, iammale, part=2>
I've never seen him in town before. Where does he come from, I wonder?
<npc=90, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=1>
I often wish I were a warrior...Like that girl over there! I'd be kicking some butt if I had muscles like hers!
<npc=99, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=2>
I've never seen her in town before. Where does she come from, I wonder?
<npc=90, iammale, iammage, part=1>
Are you attracted to mages, sis? Like the one standing over there by the tavern? He's a handsome one, not like those bleached Necromancers!
<npc=90, iamfemale, iammage, part=1>
Just look at this raggedy woman! Those magic girls imagine themselves to be the very "essence" of the world...She could have at least learned to do her makeup!
<npc=99, iamfemale, iammage, part=2>
You've got that right, sis. Maybe we should show her the shop so that she can buy some decent clothes? Poor thing...
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=3>
I have always been proud of my calmness and discretion. But if these two continue commenting about my looks, they'll pay!
#kaargwoman40
<npc=90, part=1>
Look at this fine jug of mine! A tradesman from Ushut was almost giving them away.
<npc=99, part=2>
He must have been in a hurry to get rid of his goods. All he does is sit in the tavern and squander his income on food and drink!
#kaargwoman50
<npc=90, part=1>
Where's that tradesman from Ushut? I need a new jug and he's nowhere to be found! He better not still be in the Inn, eating and drinking! How much longer are we going to wait for him?!
<npc=99, part=2>
What's the rush, sis? Are we in a hurry or something? We can stay right here and talk while we wait for him to show up.
#kaargwoman60
<npc=90, iammale, part=1>
Look, it's that handsome guy again, and he's accompanying young Sir Igles...
<npc=99, iammale, part=2>
I wonder who that country girl is that's with them? They must both be after her!
<npc=90, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=1>
Look, it's that amazon woman again, and she's accompanying young Sir Igles...
<npc=99, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=2>
I wonder who that girl is with them? They must both be after him!
<npc=90, iamfemale, iammage, part=1>
Look, it's that homely mage again, and she's accompanying young Sir Igles...
<npc=99, iamfemale, iammage, part=2>
I wonder who that girl is with them? They must both be after him!
<npc=23, part=3>
Are they talking about me? I thought our village was the only place that had annoying people!
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=4>
Where do you think rumor-mongering old ladies come from? They come from young, blabbering fools like these two!
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=4>
I'm sick of their yapping. Next time I'll ask the shopkeeper for a good, heavy mouth lock! 
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=4>
Unfortunately, I do not know the "mute" spell yet! As soon as I do, these two are going to be my guinea pigs!
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=4>
Their blabbering annoys me, too. I'll be sure to come back and take care of these two, especially the one wearing the blue dress!
#kaargwoman70
<npc=90, part=1>
Oh, I'm late! I was supposed to be home hours ago. I guess I'll have to return home with an empty jug!
<npc=99, part=2>
Me too, sis. But that gives us another reason to come here again and pick someone to pieces.
#kaargwoman80
<npc=90, iammale, part=1>
Oh, the heat really bites today! I have no wish to do anything, even talk. I can't believe that anyone would actually hit the road today...
<npc=90, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=1>
Oh, the heat really bites today! I have no wish to do anything, even talk. I can't believe that anyone would actually hit the road today...
<npc=90, iamfemale, iammage, part=1>
All of the milk we had in the cellar has turned sour overnight, and our meat is festering and rotten! This must be the work of a Mage...I just don't understand what I could've done to possibly upset one of them?!
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=2>
Think harder, darling, and you may remember the insults you were throwing at me!
#kaargwoman90
<npc=90, part=1>
What's the news, sis? I'm dying to hear some fresh rumors!
<npc=99, part=2>
Oh, lots of things are going on! People say that a Knight has found all three of the Fallen Stars and put them together. I hear something terrible happened after that!
<npc=99, part=3>
They say, a troll appeared and then hacked and mangled all his limbs for putting the Stars together...or maybe he was turned into a troll himself!
<npc=90, part=4>
Really?! My friends have to hear this! Let's see...you were saying that a troll turned into a Knight and ate all three Stars, right?
#kaargwoman100
<npc=90, part=1>
Have you heard? The King's herald announced that the Druids from the Ancient Woods have declared war on everybody!
<npc=99, part=2>
Yeah...and the Necromancers are going to prohibit leaving the town soon!
#kaargwoman110
<npc=90, part=1>
Did you hear the news? Our King has turned out to be... 
<npc=99, part=2>
Shut up, sis! The price for a misplaced word these days can be severe. Let's get home while it's relatively safe!

=====Guard at Kaarg gate =======
#kaargguard30
<npc=93, part=1>
Guarding the town gate is honorable as well as profitable. But sometimes I wish I could get down off of here and hit the road! I envy people who can decide to leave at any moment.
#kaargguard40
<npc=93, part=1>
Hey! It's my new friend! How are your travels? I'd love to hop down and join you, but my brother, Jed, is sick and I have to take care of him for a while. Oh, well...
#kaargguard50
<npc=93, part=1>
Hello again! Did you know that the view from up here is amazing? You can see for miles and miles and miles and miles...
#kaargguard60
<npc=93, part=1>
Welcome back, Adventurers! Did you slay any dragons yet? I heard that long ago, the Dragons were a race of noble creatures. Then a group of evil Mages entered their land and corrupted their very nature!
#kaargguard70
<npc=93, part=1>
Hello again! I wouldn't be able to convince you to watch my post for a while, would I? Oh, never mind...I can see that people like you would never be content to stand watch over a lowly gate.
#kaargguard80
<npc=93, part=1>
Guarding the town gate is starting to get a little boring. If only a bandit or monster would bust through the gate and start terrorizing the town...At least then I'd have something to do!
#kaargguard90
<npc=93, part=1>
The only good thing about guarding this gate is the benefits. You'd be amazed how much a thorough leeching can cost, if you aren't covered!
#kaargguard100
<npc=93, part=1>
I'll say this much...I'm earning quite a pension walking around up here. Another 20 years of this and I'll be able to afford an INDOOR bathroom!!
#kaargguard110
<npc=93, part=1>
This is just great! The world is collapsing around us and my boss still has me walking around up here, guarding some dirt and a wooden door! The Anger!

#kaargman80
<npc=21, part=1>
The more I talk to you, the more you surprise me, old man. You seem to know things not normally made available to old beggars.
<npc=92, part=2>
I wasn't always a beggar, and I wasn't always old. Once, I was chosen by Great Mage Yokke to represent him at the royal court. But Yokke unexpectedly died, and his apprentice Urd became the Great Mage of Yases.
<npc=92, part=3>
Urd hates everybody and everything associated with the name of his predecessor. He took away my wealth, and time took away my youth...But no one could take away my memories and my ability to listen and understand.
#kaargman90
<npc=92, part=1>
I overheard a group of young Knights talking about your adventures in the Hemer Desert. Your friend Igles and you are becoming famous on Yases! 
<npc=92, part=2>
I believe your fame is the only obstacle that keeps the Necromancers from declaring you traitors, spies or something of that sort in order to prosecute you. Stay alert, they are not going to put up with you much longer...
#kaargman100
<npc=92, part=1>
I already know what happened in the Ancient Woods. The Druids' trust is a fragile thing, and you have shattered that trust. Be cautious with them now! 
#kaargman110
<npc=92, part=1>
Urd has sent a secret emissary to the Necromancer Guild of this town. He is afraid of you! He's asking for assistance and protection from the Guild, but I believe it's not going to help him.

<npc=22, part=2>
I have always thought that the further you go into the Woods, the more reserved the residents become. And here you are, greeting us strangers like long, lost friends! 
<npc=94, part=3>
I already know who you are and how you earned the honor of being allowed into the Heart of the Woods. You wouldn't be here otherwise.
#druidinnkeeper70

You can stay here, drinking all night, and still leave in the morning, fresh as an opening rosebud! Such are the ancient recipes for our drinks.

<npc=94, part=1>
I never persuade people to come in. There's no need for that. Anyone who has ever tried my cuisine would never pass by!
#druidinnkeeper90

The secret of making our ale has been passed from father to son for centuries. No one outside the family knows our secret. But all honored guests can have as much ale as they want!

I don't believe the rumor that you are enemies of the Ancient Woods. My house is always open for you! Have a seat and a drink...on the house!

People say that Knights of the Plains raided the Ancient Woods. Is that true?
<npc=22, part=2>
Yes, it is true. But we weren't with them. In fact, we tried to protect the Woods! The Necromancers fooled the Knights into attacking you!
<npc=91, part=3>
It sounds like you're trying to protect your own kind...You came here as a guest, but others like you brought death and chaos into our Woods!
<npc=91, part=4>
Great Saken-Maye has not given me any instructions yet, but if he orders me to close the doors for you, I shall do so with great pleasure.

Hey, buddy! Want to make some money and buy yourself some new armor? You look like a farm boy dressed that way!

I will tell you what: if your arrows help me defeat the hazards of my next adventure, you will have yourself a share of the loot found. What do you say?

I see that you're dressed in the latest country fashions! Would you mind accompanying me? I'm about to leave town and could really use your skills.

I can offer you a job, if you like. Accompany me on my trip out of town. From your looks, I would say the countryside is more familiar to you than the city.
<npc=21, iammage, iamfemale, part=1>
Why don't you accompany me? I'll be travelling in the country soon, and you look like you'd blend in with the landscape pretty well!

Sorry, but I'm not coming with you today. 
<npc=22, part=2>

Am I going with you? Sure! As I understand, something important is going on, and I want to be a part of it.

<npc=2, part=1>
I was born in a poor family and my military rank is not that high. On the other hand, I don't have to spend all my time in the Service. I have some free days when I can rent out my sword.
#npc2accept30
<npc=22, part=1>
Greetings, friend! Why are you sitting here with the mercenaries who kill people for money?
<npc=2, part=2>
My salary is small, but my family is large...There's nothing wrong with being paid for doing something well. Of course, I wouldn't dream of charging you for my services.
#npc2reject30
<npc=22, part=1>
I think you enjoyed our last trip together. Would you care to join us again?
<npc=2, part=2>
Uhm...You know, I have my wedding anniversary today, so I promised my wife that I'd stay home. She's always had to wait for me to return from my journeys, so today, I'm staying home for her.

#npc2reject50
<npc=2, part=1>
No, friends, I'm staying in town. A guy I met promised to sell me a new, inexpensive sword, which is many times better than the one I have right now. I don't want to miss this opportunity.
#npc2accept60
<npc=2, part=1>
This time it would be a shame to reject your offer!
#npc2reject60
<npc=2, part=1>
An old wound in my leg has been hurting for the last few days. I fear that my leg will fail me at any time. You had better look for another swordsman today while I try to put myself together.

#npc2accept70

If rumors are true, you can do just fine without any help at all! I'd be honored to accompany you this time.
#npc2reject70
<npc=2, part=1>
W-w-where have you b-been? (Burp!) I've passed a couple glasses w-waiting for you! (Hiccup!) Well, maybe three...or was it four...
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=2>
Phew! He sounds like he's drank two pitchers, or possibly two kegs! You know, Igles, he doesn't look like good company right now. Maybe after he sobers up some...
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=2>
Did he say glasses? Those must have been kegs! You know, Igles, if you take him with you, I'm staying in town. He's far too gone to do us any good right now.
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=2>
I distrust this man's ability to aid us in any way. We should not take him along until he sobers up a bit.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=2>
Igles! If you decide to hire your friend here, would you please also hire two movers? I'm not going to be the one hauling him around!
<npc=22, part=3>
Yeah, this gladiator wouldn't do us any good today. We should tell his family to come here and take him back home.
#npc2accept80
<npc=2, part=1>
At last, an enjoyable job! I especially like the part about leaving the town! I'm sick of the barracks and the Necromancers are scurrying around like rats! Open spaces will do me good right about now.
#npc2reject80
<npc=2, part=1>
I'd gladly go to the Desert, or to the Woods, or anywhere else as long it's far away from the barracks! But we've just received orders to stay in the town, and I've never disobeyed orders before.
#npc2accept90
<npc=2, part=1>
The Necromancers ordered us not to leave the town without notifying them and obtaining permission from the Guild. But I swore allegiance to the King, not to them!
#npc2reject90
<npc=2, part=1>
The Necromancers are guarding the exit from the town. They might let you pass, but they will certainly arrest me for absence without leave. I am sorry, but I can not go with you. 
#npc2accept100
<npc=2, part=1>
I'm facing a tough choice, Sir Igles. I swore allegiance to the King, but the Crown of Yases is now in your hands...I don't know what to do.
<npc=22, part=2>
I do need your assistance, and I swear that all I do is done for the good of our Allod! The Crown of Yases shall warrant my good will.

The Necromancers threaten to harm my family if I help you. My hands are tied while my relatives are in danger.
#npc2accept110

Our barracks are in turmoil. Everybody is pissed off about having been ruled by a zombie...And I have the biggest grudge of everybody. Take me to battle!
#npc2reject110

After you brought our zombie King to justice, the Necromancers became rabid! I must stay with my family. I am the only one who can protect them from the Guild.

#npc3accept60
<npc=3, part=1>
I would gladly weave the music of magic into the battle song of steel. Lead on!

Although I have decided to assist you, it doesn't mean that I am relieved of my other responsibilities in the Woods.
#npc3accept70

I don't often leave the Ancient Woods, but my magic will remain strong even in the sweltering Deserts or the gloomy Mountains.
#npc3reject70

This is not a good day for Druid magic. The phase of the moon and the position of the stars predict my failure. I would rather stay here today.

Aren't you asking for my help a little too often? I may become disappointed with you if you can't take care of yourself...

O wise Arafel-Faye! We are always grateful for your assistance, but this time our journey will be more dangerous than ever. Your help will be much appreciated.

I haven't lived this long by sitting still. You could say that the opposite is true. I thrive on danger. Lead the way!
#npc3reject90

Great Saken-Maye is disappointed with my performance of my Ancient Woods duties. He believes I am spending too much time with you. You will have to do without me this time.
#npc3accept100
<npc=3, part=1>
I am not backing out on my promise. I shall help you if you so wish. However, keep in mind that after the attack of the royal army, Great Saken-Maye may change his policies towards people from the Plain at any moment!
#npc3reject100
<npc=3, part=1>
Great Saken-Maye has made his decision. You are still allowed into the Ancient Woods, but it is prohibited for any Druids to assist you in any way.
#npc3accept110
<npc=3, part=1>
Judgment Day for the Ancient Woods is coming! I want to be in the middle of the events.
<npc=22, part=2>
I can't believe that you only care about your Woods. Doesn't anything else matter to you?
<npc=3, part=3>
You only care about your precious Plains, don't you? You and I are very different. We are pursuing the same goal right now, but who knows what will happen later?
#npc3reject110

Are you saying that my skill is not adequate for the task at hand?

<NPC=22, part=5>
My uncle, an important army officer, wants me to make a career for myself. But I have no desire to serve the King.
<npc=21, part=6>
Why not? Everybody thinks that royal service means honor and respect. And would you not enjoy seeing the King every day? Not to mention the receptions and all of the grand dances...
<NPC=22, part=7>
Maybe that was the way a hundred years ago, but it's different nowadays. King doesn't even show his face to anyone. He wears his armor and helmet, as if he were expecting an assassination attempt!
<NPC=22, part=8>
Even the highest of nobles are often not admitted to the palace. The King rarely gives his orders himself these days. They are usually conveyed to us by his retainer mages instead.
<NPC=22, part=9>
And those orders don't make sense, either. Take the army drafts, for instance. They draft everybody they can get, but the army STILL can't maintain order on the Allod!
<NPC=21, PART=10>
Who are those retainer mages you mentioned? What do they do?
<NPC=22, iamfemale, part=11>
Where do you come from? The Moon? Long ago only a few people knew of the existence of the Necromancer Guild. These days Necromancers are everywhere, including the royal court.

<npc=21, part=1>
Excuse me, good man, are you a merchant?
<npc=2108, part=2>
Yes, I am. But you should go to the shop if you want to buy something. I have a wholesale agreement with the shopkeeper. We end up making more money that way!
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=3>
Well, it's going to take you a long time to become rich if you keep selling that junk! You have absolutely nothing of value to buy! No mithril crossbows, no adamantine swords...You don't seem to be supplying the shop very well!
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=3>
Hmmm, well the two of you stink at being businessmen. The shop may as well be empty! No mithril crossbows, no adamantine swords...Where's all the good stuff, anyway?
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=3>
I doubt that you are making very good profit. Most of the items in the shop are inexpensive and can not be marked up that high. Why is it a problem for you to supply quality goods?
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=3>
Yeah, and your outfit certainly shows your fortune! The shop only sells cheap weapons, and the spellbooks are scarce...Being a merchant means selling the best goods at the lowest prices!
<npc=2108, iammale, iamfighter, part=4>
Don't salt my wounds, warrior! Until recently, every time I came to Kaarg I brought with me several great adamantine swords made by Galen from Sheep's Shallow.

Don't salt my wounds, woman! Until recently, every time I came to Kaarg I brought with me several great adamantine swords made by Galen from Sheep's Shallow.
<npc=2108, part=5>
But some time ago Galen stopped coming to our meeting place, so I've ended up losing my source of income. I almost went broke with those cheap goods. Everybody in Kaarg knows about it.
<npc=2108, part=6>
I tried to hire someone to travel to Sheep's Shallow and find out what happened to Galen.  But I can't pay in advance, and my credit is very low these days.
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=7>
Sounds like a song I know: "Nobody knows you when you're down an' out..." Actually, I can try to find the blacksmith for you. Cash on delivery. Deal?
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=7>
Are you surprised? Have you ever sold things to people for just a promise to pay later? Anyway, I can find this blacksmith for you. You can pay me later, but just remember that cheating on me is bad for your health. Deal?
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=7>
Well today's your lucky day! I would be willing to ascertain information about the blacksmith without prepayment. I suppose you wouldn't consider upsetting a mage just for the sake of money. Deal?
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=7>
They are just afraid of being cheated. I'll find Galen for you. You can pay me later, but just in case you are not going to play fair, beware! Mages are experts at revenge! Deal?
<npc=2108, iamfighter, part=8>
Deal! You have my merchant's word that I shall pay you in full.
<npc=2108, iammage, part=8>
You don't have to threaten me; I'm not a scoundrel. I'm an honest merchant and you have my word that I shall pay you in full.

So what can you say about that strange thing the headman gave us? It seems to be a part of something, something resembling a crown...

Exactly! A crown indeed! Remember seeing the King's statue here in town? Remember what his crown looks like? Now, imagine it broken into three pieces!

There's no doubt we have a part of the Crown of Yases! But how could this happen? It's not just a pretty piece of jewelry. It's an extremely powerful magical artifact.
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=4>
So that's why I noticed the piece glowing slightly in the dark! What's the story of the magic crown?

I was wondering why I started seeing sparks if I stared at it for too long...So what's the story of the magic crown?

You did not have to explain that to me. It is hard not to sense the magic of this item.  But who made the magic crown?
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=4>
I knew this from the beginning, but I didn't want to disturb you. This piece is glowing with a magical aura! But who could make such a crown?
<npc=22, part=5>
Long ago it was given to the very first King of Yases by the Necromancer Guild. The spell on the crown protects its bearer from the magic of astral!
<npc=22, part=6>
This was the condition set by the ancient King when he allowed the Necromancers to form a guild in his lands. The sovereign of Yases must be protected from their magic.
<npc=22, part=7>
But nobody has seen the present King wearing this crown for quite some time. He's always wearing a helmet with a faceplate now.
<npc=22, part=8>
People say he's been doing that almost since the day when Urd, the chief of the Necromancer Guild, took the place of the deceased Great Mage Yokke.
<NPC=21, PART=9 >
I can't believe we really possess a piece of the Crown of Yases!
<npc=22, part=10>
I don't understand...who in his right mind would break the Crown into pieces? And what does it have to do with the Stars?
<NPC=21, PART=11>
We shouldn't be talking so loud. People will start listening to our conversation...Too late, one of them has turned to us. Let's hope he's drunk enough to forget what he's heard. 
<npc=2108, part=12 >
I don't f-forget nuttin'. You were talking about s-stars (hic), but you don't know annnnything about them. We in Ushut have an old man w-who knows everything about the stars! 
<npc=2108, part=13 >
He lives a couple leagues south of sanity though, and b-brings up his granddaughter in the same way...But he's really good at this star business. Hey, waiter, more beer! I w-want to drink to my astrologer friends!
<NPC=21, IAMMALE, IAMFIGHTER, part=14 >
Drink, good man, and mind your own business. 
<NPC=21, IAMMALE, IAMFIGHTER, part=15 >
Tell me, Igles, what kind of a place is this Ushut? 
<NPC=21, IAMFEMALE, IAMFIGHTER, part=14 >
Drink 'till you drop, hopefully you will choke and shut up! 
<NPC=21, IAMFEMALE, IAMFIGHTER, part=15 >
Tell me, Igles...What sort of a place is this Ushut? 
<NPC=21, IAMMALE, IAMMAGE part=14 >
I hope this dipsomaniac is more interested in his beer than in our business. 
<NPC=21, IAMMALE, IAMMAGE part=15>
By the way, Sir Igles, how far is Ushut? And what kind of a place is it?
<NPC=21, IAMFEMALE, IAMMAGE part=14 >
I suggest that you drink to your wretched liver, good man. 
<NPC=21, IAMFEMALE, IAMMAGE part=15 >
Nevertheless, this drunk said something interesting...What kind of a place is Ushut?
<NPC=22, PART=16>
It's a small town, more of a village really, not far from the capital. I think that we should see if this astrologer really exists. He might be able to explain a couple of things to us!

<npc=2111, part=1>
I came in to town to ask for protection for my village. We are in great danger and need help!
<npc=22, part=2>
So what are you doing in a tavern? Don't you have a Lord you can talk to? He's the first person you should address with such a request.
<npc=2111, part=3>
We have a Lord, but he doesn't care about our problems. Our village is located in the barren heights. We're poor farmers and can't pay him his taxes. The Lord said that the Dragon is our punishment for not paying.
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=4>
Dragon? What kind of a Dragon? If it's green, that means it's young and can be warded off with your hunting bows. You wouldn't be able to kill it, of course, but it wouldn't bother you for a while.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=4>
Dragons are different from each other. If it's green, then it's young and you can deal with it by yourselves. Gather a couple dozen archers and give it some pain! It won't die, but it would leave you alone.
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=4>
If the Dragon is green then it is young and inexperienced, so you can deal with it by yourselves. Gather as many archers as you can muster, and you will certainly ward it off for a long time.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=4>
A Dragon, huh? It's easy to get rid of the young green ones. Stuffing one with arrows would most certainly make it forget the way to your village if it survives.
<npc=2111, iammale, part=5>
Thank you for the advice, good Sir, but this Dragon is so strong that it doesn't even notice our arrows. Our local mages say that this beast is exceptional, even among the other Dragons!
<npc=2111, iamfemale, part=5>
Thank you for the advice, good lady, but this Dragon is so strong that it doesn't even notice our arrows. Our local mages say that this beast is exceptional, even among the other Dragons!

It is a disgrace to the noble families that they deny help to the people who can't pay them! I am not your Lord, but I shall challenge that Dragon for you!
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=7>
You mean "we" rather than "I", don't you? Do you think I'm going to stand here and just watch you get all the glory?
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=7>
Why are you saying "I shall challenge" when the words "we shall challenge" sound so much better! Don't imagine that I'll stay out of this fight!
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=7>
It would be more accurate to say "we shall challenge." I would like to be a part of this particular battle.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=7>
"We challenge," not "I challenge." Although I poke fun at the peasants every once in a while, I know right from wrong and I'm not going to stay out of this fight!

Sir Igles! The Necromancer Guild has authorized me to officially apologize for the incident in Lyrisha.
<npc=2004, part=2>
Investigation of the circumstances has revealed that there was no royal order for the draft. The incident was caused by the unauthorized actions of a Guild member.
<npc=2004, part=3>
The responsible person is a renegade named Kshorg. He and his accomplices were banished from the Guild and fled to the border of the sands and the mountains. They are continuing their operations from a base there.

Sir Igles, your land was most damaged by Kshorg's actions. It would then be fair if you were to bring justice to the renegades.

<NPC=23, part=1>
According to my grandpa's notes, the first Star fell near the village of Lyrisha...
<NPC=22, part=2>
We already have that Star. It was a gift from the villagers, and that's why we started this quest. Read more, what else does it say?
<NPC=23, part=3>
Have some patience...The second Star must be somewhere in the Ancient Woods, while the third one has fallen in the south, where the orcs and the goblins dwell.
<NPC=21, part=4>
So where should we go first?
<NPC=22, part=5>
It's hard to tell. The Druids populate the Ancient Woods. They don't welcome strangers from the Plains into their lands...
<NPC=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=6>
What do you mean, "don't welcome?" Are they going to gouge our eyes out and break our elbows as soon as we enter?
<NPC=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=6>
Judging from your tone of voice, "don't welcome" means that they'll have our kneecaps split and our bodies burned away! Did I get that right?
<NPC=21, iammale, iammage, part=6>
Your words and intonation leave no doubt: the one who enters the Ancient Woods will have his liver removed and his bowels released. Did I phrase that precisely enough?
<NPC=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=6>
What's that "don't welcome" supposed to mean? Does it mean that the one who enters gets his nostrils raped and his bottom burned off?
<NPC=22, part=7>
I have no idea. There just isn't much known about them. For example, my uncle says that the King's warriors shall find nothing but death in the land of the Druids.
<NPC=22, part=8>
However, he also mentioned that some people managed to earn their trust, but nobody knows how they did it.
<NPC=23, part=9>
And my grandpa considered them noble and just. He said that they respect anybody's beliefs as long as that person does the same for others.
<NPC=21, part=10>
Well, enough about the Druids. What do we know about the location to the south?
<NPC=22, part=11>
Nothing good there, either. When the world was broken into the Allods, a horde of orcs and goblins stayed on Yases, and tried to conquer the Allod.
<NPC=22, part=12>
Their raids fought against our army, however the King's warriors couldn't completely destroy them, so a fragile balance was reached that lasted to this day.
<NPC=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=13>
Looks like a tough choice. I say we leave town, and then take the road we like better!
<NPC=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=13>
Choosing between the two evils is not worth the effort of thought. I say leave the town and then flip a coin!
<NPC=21, iammale, iammage, part=13>
The choice is difficult. I would suggest leaving town and then considering our options again.
<NPC=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=13>
Yeah, it is not a simple choice is it? Actually, I don't care where we go first, to the woods or to the Desert. My magic will work anywhere.

Hi, Igles! I see it's still easier to find you in the tavern than in your own home! 
<NPC=22, PART=2>
At least here no one reminds me of the necessity to become a "perfect officer." My folks just can't understand that noble families aren't all that important on our Allod anymore. 
<npc=2, part=3>
Unfortunately, you are right. The Necromancers are acquiring more and more power, even in the army. They aren't giving the orders yet, but they can make the officers do what they want.
<NPC=22, PART=4>
Some of them have already tried to give orders in my land, so I had to remind them just who was the master. Of course, you don't need to announce this in the marketplace.
<NPC=22, PART=5>
I don't want to believe that the Necromancers I fought were actually following the Guild's orders. It must have been at the initiative of some rebel Necromancers.
<NPC=22, PART=6>
Even so, their impudence is intolerable! I am afraid that one lesson won't be enough for them.
<npc=2, part=7>
You're not the only one irritated with the dominance of the Necromancer Guild. Even the army officers are ready to rise against them...I heard that a whole regiment has rebelled already! 
<npc=2, part=8>
The commander kicked out the mages and then took his troops to the mountains. A huge force is gathering to punish the rebels...I hope I'm not making a mistake trusting you and your friends?
<NPC=22, PART=9>
You did right by telling us. I can't make any promises, but I have a strong suspicion that the rebels won't be the ones who get punished. By the way, why didn't you rush to their rescue?
<npc=2, part=10>
Like all soldiers, I have sworn an allegiance to the King. We must obey his orders as long as he is alive. It is not that easy to break one's oath, you know!

<npc=2019, part=3>
I know the way to go. I did it with some guys before but they're not here now. I can't make it alone so, the deal is you take me through, I pay cash, and no questions asked.

Listen, Sir Igles! This man talks very strangely. We may be better off if we don't go with him anywhere.
<npc=22, part=5>
Oh please Dina, I told you not to call me "Sir!" As for this man, some people do talk differently, but he is asking for help, after all...
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=6>
Besides, he is offering good money, which we can use. I think we should do what he asks. It wouldn't take a long time to help him out.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=6>
Besides, there is no such thing as excess money. I'm sick of saving on things. I say that we should take him through the Woods.
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=6>
We also should keep in mind the financial aspect of this affair. Our funds are quite limited right now...I suggest that we help this man and collect the reward.

He's actually a known felon, a gang chief. He was brought to Kaarg for trial, but managed to escape.

We then moved to a town in the south of the Plains, and I have heard nothing about you since then. How are you doing? How is your grandpa?
<npc=23, part=3>
Some outlaws hired by the Necromancers Guild killed my grandpa. Now people from the Guild say that they were renegades and scoundrels...Not that it's a relief.
<npc=2109, part=4>
Oh, I'm so sorry...I hope the thugs have been punished.
<npc=2109, part=5>
Our town is in trouble, too. Evil monsters have besieged us! There is no one to ward them off. The royal army seems to have more important tasks than helping a small village under attack.
<npc=2109, part=6>
We hoped that our local female mage, Talena, would be able to help. It turns out that mages are not all that powerful. Talena actually had to abandon her tower and seek refuge in our town!
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=7>
I wonder what sort of magic she uses that doesn't even work against animals?
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=7>
Yeah, that sort of magic wouldn't be worth very much!
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=7>
I suppose that she is not qualified to become a mage yet.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=7>
Oh Great Powers! And she dares to call herself a mage!
<npc=2109, part=8>
Oh no, no. She is a very nice person. It's just that she's studied more about ancient tales and legends than battle magic.
<npc=2109, part=9>
She can tell you astonishing things about the old times. It's too bad that her tales can't help us now.
<npc=23, part=9>
I say that we do what we can! Let's help the people of this town!

Well, we have a lot to do yet...but I don't mind. What do you say, Igles?

We want to find all three of these Fallen Stars. There are many indications that when they are put together, life on Yases will change for the good, and the turmoil of the recent years will end.
<NPC=23, part=3>
My grandpa, an astrologer, had determined that one of the Stars has fallen somewhere in the Ancient Woods, and that's why we're here. Who knows more about the Woods than the Druids? You can help us!
<npc=680, part=4>
Yes. I know what you are talking about. But finding a Fallen Star is not much easier than obtaining one of those that shine in the sky! Listen now to this story I tell...
<npc=680, part=5>
An Elven family lives in the westernmost part of the Allod. They had come here before the seeds of the first trees of the Ancient Woods fell into the ground.
<npc=680, part=6>
Even Great Saken-Maye, the lord of the Druids, knows not a hundredth of what is fathomed by the Elves. Their thoughts are obscure, and mysterious, but even they can not hide from the trees.
<npc=680, part=7>
In the Night of the Omen, one of the Stars did indeed descend into the Ancient Woods. One of the Elves happened to behold its fall.
<npc=680, part=8>
No one except the surrounding trees saw him pick up that Star and take it away. The trees told us, and now we tell you this secret.
<npc=680, part=9>

It is not our custom to request help from Plain dwellers, especially warriors. However, sometimes life makes it a necessity.
<NPC=21, part=2>
What happened? And what kind of assistance do you require?
<npc=681, part=3>
There is a small village on the Plain frontier, which is being raided by throngs of carnivorous squirrels. These pests are besieging the village for no reason!
<npc=681, part=4>
The inhabitants of this village have always been good neighbors to us. I want to help them overcome this problem; however, their Lord is very suspicious of Druids.
<npc=681, part=5>
If our armed force appears there to aid the peasants, he would perceive it as an invasion. It wouldn't be nearly as complicated if a noble Knight does the same.
<NPC=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=6>
It shouldn't be much of a feat to fight simple squirrels...We'll wipe them out for you!
<NPC=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=6>
Don't worry! It shouldn't be very dangerous to exterminate simple squirrels. We'll do this for you, no problem!
<NPC=21, iammale, iammage, part=6>
Yes, I understand. Well, we are undoubtedly capable of destroying some rabid squirrels.  Such a task would be boring rather than dangerous.
<NPC=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=6>
Don't worry! In a day or two only smoking chunks of meat will remain of those carnivores, I promise.
<npc=681, part=7>
No, no, no! I have no intention of killing the animals at all! Their attack on the village peasants only means that something must be preventing them from living their normal life.
<npc=681, part=8>
If you find and eliminate this reason, you will be able to aid the peasants without slaughtering all of the squirrels. This is what I want from you!

Everybody knows that your friends and you have defeated the Orcish armies in the Desert.

People tend to exaggerate. We have indeed traveled to the Desert, but it wasn't nearly as glorious as you say. Shall we get down to business now?
<npc=2108, part=5>
Our Guild has been sending caravans into the mountains for many years. The caravan path winds through the Orcish lands.
<npc=2108, part=6>
We have spent a lot of money and effort to make this path reasonably safe. For some time now almost all of the caravans made it to their destination safely.
<npc=2108, part=7>
However, recently we started losing more and more. The caravans would just disappear! We petitioned the King, but our request was turned down. He values his soldiers too much to send them to the Desert.

You, Sir Igles, are the one not afraid of the sands. On behalf of the Trade Guild, I beg you to satisfy our request and deal with our misfortune. Of course, your compensation will be well worth it.

Well, if you insist. You are aware that there is trouble on Yases. Horrible crimes are happening in remote parts of the Allod.
<npc=22, part=4>
Yes, we know that. For some unknown reason we always meet a Necromancer or two on the crime site. It's been worrying me for a while!
<npc=2004, part=5>
Yes, there are renegades among us, but our internal investigations unit is working on it. It seems that the noble Lords are responsible for these outrageous actions! Have you heard about Sir Teyrack?
<npc=22, part=6>
Yes I do. He is greedy and cruel and because of that he has become rich and powerful. I wouldn't want him to be my Lord. There is, in fact, a long standing feud between our two families.
<npc=2004, part=7>
We were informed that Teyrack is violating the King's law in his land, by using his personal guards to terrorize the population. Even the noble Knights are not safe in his land!
<npc=2004, part=8>
However, if the Necromancer Guild sends a pacification force, it would cause undesired attention. It would be more appropriate if one of the Kings Knights performed that function...
<npc=22, part=9>
And that's me, right?

The legend of the Source of Magic has long intrigued people. Search parties are from time to time sent by wealthy mages, or sometimes by the state to find the Source.
<npc=2022, part=2>
Our King sent the last such party, not long before the falling of the Three Stars.
<npc=22, part=3>
Right, I believe I heard about it, but it's been a long time. Most of the warriors that took part in it must have died, and those alive must be very old by now.
<npc=2022, part=4>
You are right. I only know of one name for sure; it is Sir Barross. Igles, can you find out where he lives now?
<npc=22, part=5>
I don't see why not. I don't have many friends in the palace, but I can rely on those I do have. I'll ask them to look up his current address in the archives.
<npc=2022, part=6>
Well, in that case, would you be able to meet him and learn the location of the Source of Magic? 
<npc=22, part=7>
I believe so. I think that Sir Barross would be happy to have the opportunity to tell about his adventures in the good old days.

<npc=2022, part=2>
I heard that the inhabitants of the Ancient Woods have also tried to locate it. I know the whereabouts of a Druid that participated in an expedition to find the Source.
<npc=21, part=3>
You don't have to say anything else! I understand. You want us to find him and find out as much as we can about that journey, right?
<npc=2022, part=4>
Exactly. As far as I know, you've already been to the Ancient Woods, and you even managed to earn the trust of the locals.
<npc=22, part=5>
Well, I guess you can say that, although I doubt that the Druids trust anyone completely.
<npc=22, part=6>
I'm not so sure that this Druid would start telling us his secrets as soon as we meet him.  We'll give it a try, anyway.

The legend of the Source of Magic has long intrigued people. Search parties are from time to time sent by wealthy mages, or sometimes by the state to find the Source.
<npc=2022, part=2>
Our king sent the last such party, not long before the falling of the Three Stars. Both warriors and members of the Necromancer Guild participated in the excursion.
<npc=22, part=3>
Right, I believe I heard about it, too. However, it was quite a long while ago. All members of the party must have already died by now.
<npc=2022, part=4>
Correct. But it's possible to summon the spirit of a dead member of that party, and ask him questions about the trip.
<npc=2022, part=5>
A Necromancer would best suit this task as they are versed in the magic of Raise the Dead.
<npc=21, part=6>
This also implies that a Necromancer must summon the spirit. I'm not exactly thrilled with that prospect.
<npc=2022, part=7>
This is the only way to learn the whereabouts of the Source of Magic. Unfortunately, I don't know where the party members are buried...
<npc=22, part=8>
Well, I can find that out. I don't have many friends in the palace, but I can rely on those I have. We shall leave as soon as I determine our destination.

What happened to you, warrior? You look like you've been in a fierce battle...And your face looks familiar. Aren't you from that regiment that rebelled against the Necromancers? 
<npc=2010, part=2>
Ay. It wasn't a battle though. It was a slaughter! Our regiment has been destroyed and I am the only survivor! We were just plain warriors and we couldn't resist the battle magic cast down upon us...Our swords were useless!
<npc=2010, part=3>
It was a miracle that saved me that day. I was wounded, but managed to crawl into some bushes and stay unnoticed. The enemies walked around, almost stepping on my fingers! I spent many horrible hours there!
<npc=2010, part=4>
I found out why our regiment was doomed by listening to their conversations. It turned out that the Necromancers have a secret battle mage training ground far up in the mountains. 
<npc=2010, part=5>
They are almost invulnerable to regular weapons. The only way to defeat them is to use the same magic as they use. I only wish we had a skilled mage with us that day...

After the Necromancer Guild became so important on Yases, it started controlling all the other mage Guilds!
<npc=2009, part=2>
Any attempt to disobey their orders resulted in an encounter with their thugs, who were specially trained to resist magic.
<npc=2009, part=3>
The encounter usually happens as a robbery or theft, and of course, there is no connection with the Necromancer Guild. But those assaults happen exactly when the Guild can benefit from them the most.
<npc=2009, part=4>
We were recently informed of where this gang hides between assaults. Their hideout is located on the islands of a remote mountain lake.
<npc=2009, part=5>
The mages of Yases will generously reward the persons who agree to go there and destroy the gang.
<npc=2009, part=6>
Rest assured, the Necromancer Guild will not be able to bring up any charges against you. They have made numerous public claims that these people are criminals and need to be brought to justice!

<npc=677, part=2>
There is a tale. A big spider made-made a web, and then it turned into rocks. Black shamans came-came, and inhabited the spider's den.
<npc=677, part=3>

Look, Talena! We found this Minge-Shaman, but he didn't clear things up at all. He knows nothing about the magic phrase that gives access to the Source of Magic.
<npc=21, part=2>
"Tekel knows!" - that's the way he put it. Tekel must be some sort of idol that knows everything but stays silent, right?
<npc=2022, part=3>
Yes, Tekel is an idol indeed, but it can speak, although reluctantly.
<npc=2022, part=4>
To avoid being bothered with stupid questions, Tekel has surrounded himself with minions that attack everything that moves. It's not easy to get past them.
<npc=2022, part=5>
That's why the orcs keep saying, "Tekel knows" about things that can only be learned with great effort and risk.
<npc=22, part=6>
This means that we can actually learn the key words! We're stronger and smarter than the orcs, so we should be able to reach this idol with no problem!

<npc=2022, part=1>
So how are you doing? Did you manage to find the old Knight and talk to him?
<npc=21, part=2>
I'm afraid not. He died, and his death was not from old age! It seems that someone wanted to keep him quiet, and permanently shut his mouth. This business stinks!
<npc=22, part=3>
We only managed to talk to his son. He told us what he remembered of his father's tales about the expedition to the Source of Magic.
<npc=21, part=4>
Anyway, we know how to get there, but there's no point in going. You'll need to know some kind of "magic word" to be able to use the Source, and there is no way of learning it.
<npc=22, part=5>
As a matter of fact, we only have one faint lead. Barross' son mentioned an old mage, a storyteller who knows lots of legends and myths.
<npc=22, part=6>
We wanted to ask you whether we should bother finding this man. Is it possible that this old man living in the middle of nowhere would know the words we are looking for?
<npc=2022, part=7>
Certainly! Ancient knowledge usually resides in just this sort of place. You absolutely must find the storyteller. I'm sure he'll be able to help you.

So, how are you doing? Did you manage to talk to the Druid? Did he tell what you wanted to know? It must have been a complicated task.
<npc=21, part=2>
Oh, it was as simple as it could be. I only had to smile, and this Druid told me all that he knew!
<npc=22, part=3>
Well, actually it was a bit different...but just a bit. Anyway, the Druid's story may lead us on another journey. Look, Talena, have you heard of a mage named Wordock?
<npc=2022, part=4>
Wordock...Of course! This man searches for ancient knowledge, much like myself. However, he had to flee from his home and seek refuge.
<npc=2022, part=5>
The King's soldiers want him for some secret that he supposedly knows. He actually doesn't know anything, but try telling that to the King.
<npc=22, part=6>
Then it is up to you whether we should learn the magic word that gives access to the Source of Magic. The Druid is convinced that Wordock knows the word, although he has no idea how valuable it is.
<npc=22, part=7>
You have to decide whether you trust us enough to tell us where to find Wordock.
<npc=2022, part=8>
This is a tough decision...But I trust you and your friends, Igles. You wouldn't hurt an old mage. You can find him in the western part of the Swampland.

<npc=21, part=3>
We are now facing a search for the Necromancers' library. It's supposed to contain a manuscript with this secret phrase.
<npc=21, part=4>
I believe that the owners of the manuscript are not aware of its true value.
<npc=2022, part=5>
Well, I can only wish you luck. It will be a great accomplishment if you manage to find the key to the Source of Magic!

#npc2004talk90
<npc=2004, part=1>
This time I come not on behalf of the Necromancer Guild, but in the name of the King! Sir Igles has been honored with a personal order from His Majesty!
<npc=2004, part=2>
His Majesty is very concerned with your demonstrated lack of respect towards his loyal servants from the Necromancer Guild.
<npc=2004, part=3>
It is even more disturbing considering your family tradition of faithful service to the Kings of Yases. However, at the same time His Majesty is pleased with your success in the Orc campaigns.
<npc=2004, part=4>
In light of recent events, His Majesty orders you to travel to the western region and participate in the suppression of a local rebellion which is being supported by throngs of demonic beasts.
<npc=2004, part=5>
If you comply with this order, the King will be satisfied and his wrath shall not fall upon you or your family!
<npc=22, part=6>
It was my duty to hear the King's order. However, I have no wish to tolerate your presence any longer.
<npc=22, part=7>
I've seen too many crimes committed by your brethren in remote parts of Yases. I believed that the Guild was not aware, but the more I see the more this belief fades.
<npc=2004, part=8>
If you could only comprehend how painful your words are, Sir Igles! Yes, there is still some corruption among us, but please be assured that the Guild is striving to purify its ranks.
<npc=2004, part=9>
Of course, sometimes we make mistakes, but we are also willing to forgive the mistakes made by others. Otherwise the Guild would have prosecuted you long ago. Doing so would be well within our rights, and justified!
<npc=2004, part=10>
Your actions haven't always been lawful, but the Necromancer Guild knows that you are a loyal servant to your King. Fulfill his order and you shall be forgiven!

There is nothing nicer to the eye than the gentle swinging of the tree branches and the emerald green of the leaves. Still some of us leave the Ancient Woods seeking new knowledge of the Allods.
<npc=681, part=2>
One of our scientists became so absorbed in his study of the Orcs that he decided to move to the Desert a while ago. We now call him the Orcologist.
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=3>
So let him enjoy his life there. It's none of our business.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=3>
How unfortunate...Not that we care, though. Everyone has a right to ruin his life if they so choose.
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=3>
A strange decision indeed. However, I do not see anything of interest to us in this information.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=3>
Oh, that's so romantic! I hope he enjoys his bucolic life in those stupid sands. We won't have anything to do with this, will we?
<npc=681, part=4>
Well, his servant just recently arrived here with a letter requiring our assistance in an important matter.
<npc=681, part=5>
Frankly, I haven't been able to find a Druid who would agree to leave our Woods and head out for the Desert. But, after all, this scientist is one of us...
<npc=681, part=6>
To put it bluntly, I want you to go see the Orcologist and find out what he wants. It might be very important for him.
<npc=23, part=7>
Yes, of course we'll go! The Scientists are a very special breed of people. Helping him would be an honor!
<npc=22, part=8>
I agree with Dina. If we have some spare time to travel to the sands, we should help the Orcologist with his problem.

A lot has changed in this world, and more changes are coming. Just yesterday I couldn't imagine accepting help from people, but today I'm almost begging for it.
<npc=2003, part=2>
Some time ago...I beg your pardon, from the human point of view it would be time immemorial...Anyway, Esgel, the greatest of war leaders of all time, was killed in battle. 
<npc=2003, part=3>
No one among humans could match him in a one-on-one fight, and no one knew the art of war better. Esgel's army always won, even when greatly outnumbered by enemy forces.
<npc=2003, part=4>
His people had a custom of burning their dead, but they decided to embalm Esgel's body and bury it in a specially built mausoleum to honor his deeds. I just learned that the Guild has found this place!
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=5>
Frankly, this doesn't worry me much. The Necromancers will get one zombie in addition to the thousands that they already have. Did I miss something?
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=5>
So what? The Necromancers will just make another zombie. Maybe I don't know magic well enough, but this doesn't seem too horrible to me.
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=5>
Perhaps, my knowledge of magic is insufficient to comprehend the danger of this situation.  So far the worst consequence I can see is the creation of another zombie.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=5>
It is embarrassing to admit that I know little about the magic of the Necromancers. So far your story doesn't sound very ominous. They would just end up making another zombie, wouldn't they?
<npc=2003, part=6>
Your knowledge is limited indeed. You were right by saying that regular zombies are not very dangerous, as they can not think or talk. However, the most skilled Necromancers are capable of making them intelligent.
<npc=2003, part=7>
Such creatures retain all abilities, skills and knowledge that they had while being alive, except that they are completely controlled by their creator.
<npc=2003, part=8>
If Esgel joins the Necromancers...It will be horrible! You, humans, must prevent this by protecting his mausoleum from the Necromancers at all costs.
<npc=22, part=9>
We understand you, Elf. Esgel's remains shall not be disturbed!

Igles! I need to talk to you. The noble families of Yases have long worried about the Necromancer Guild, but they weren't stupid enough to openly confront them! What were you thinking??
<npc=2006, part=2>
Have you forgotten that we all serve the King, and that we must obey his will as long as he is alive? Your action may be qualified as treason!
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=3>
I'm an ordinary man, so excuse me for putting things simply. I've often heard that "as long as the King is alive" line...but no one has ever asked himself or herself if the King is actually alive! Who has last seen his face?
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=3>
It’s the same old song again and again: "while the King is alive, while the King is alive"...I'm sick of it! Has anyone thought if he really IS alive? Who's wearing his helmet? Where's his crown?
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=3>
There is a small peculiarity here. Why do you think that the King is alive? Especially considering that neither his face nor his crown has been seen for such a long time.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=3>
Aren't you tired of repeating "while the King is alive" noble Sir? How can you be so sure that he IS alive? When was the last time you saw his face or at least his crown?
<npc=2006, part=4>
How dare you say that! And how dare you interrupt the conversation of two noble Knights!!
<npc=22, part=5>
Calm down, uncle. My friends and I have found and put together the Three Fallen Stars. They turned out to be pieces of the Crown of Yases! Now, I possess the Crown!
<npc=2006, part=6>
What?? Are you saying that the Crown of Yases was broken and scattered across the Allod? This is outrageous! Who could do that? Better yet, how and why did that happen?!!
<npc=22, part=7>
The answer to these questions would also explain everything else that's happening on the Allod. But who could know that answer?
<npc=2006, part=8>
The King would know. In accordance with the laws of our Allod, representatives of the gentry may annually ask three questions to the King, and he must answer!
<npc=22, part=9>
I believe that the Necromancers are involved in this. If they are, they'll do anything to prevent you from asking these questions to the King. They could restrict access to the palace, or something equally effective.
<npc=23, part=10>
Excuse me for interrupting. Doesn't the King leave his palace once in a while? Maybe it's possible to meet him somewhere else besides the palace...
<npc=2006, part=11>
My, but aren't you a smart lass! The King stays in his palace almost all the time, except when he goes to his hunting grounds. They're well guarded, but not nearly as well as the palace.

There's nothing you can do about it. People need heroes, and you fit that role quite well.  I was going to offer all of you a real heroic task...in the Desert for a change.

Get on with it then!

As you know, I study the customs of the Orcs of Yases, as well as their legends and tales.  Among other things, they often mention a certain Oracle used by the shamans.
