Listen, I have to ask you. How come you know nothing about the omen of the Three Stars? It's known everywhere on Yases, from the Eastern deserts to the Western woods.
<npc=21, iammale, part=2>
It is...well...I've lived on another Allod for a long time, and moved here just a short while ago.
<npc=21, iamfemale, part=2>

Huh! Maybe I've just befriended a Kanian spy then!
<npc=22, iamfemale, part=3>
Huh! Maybe I've just befriended a Kanian spy then!
<npc=22, part=4>
Why are you silent? Sorry about that...I was making a joke, but it seems to have turned out to be offensive rather than funny.
<npc=21, iammale, part=5>
Oh no, I'm not offended. But just in case, I will answer this question seriously. I am NOT spying for the Kanian Empire. You have my word on it.
<npc=21, iamfemale, part=5>
Oh no, I'm not offended. But just in case, I will answer this question seriously. I am NOT spying for the Kanian Empire. You have my word on it.

<npc=2112, iammale, part=1>
I am the mayor of Ushut, and I am pleased to welcome such a noble traveler. May I ask what brings you here?
<npc=2112, iamfemale, part=1>
I am the mayor of Ushut, and I am pleased to welcome such a charming visitor. May I ask what brings you here?
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=2 >
I heard that an old astrologer lives somewhere around here. I'd like to talk to him.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=2>
Maybe you can tell me where to find the old astrologer who lives around here? I would like to see him.
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=2>
I am looking for an astrologer of some years. He is supposed to live around here near your town.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=2 >
Thanks for the compliment. But let's get down to business. I'm looking for an old astrologer who is rumored to live around here.
<npc=2112, part=3>
A strange detachment recently passed through our town. Actually, I would rather call them a gang. There were no noble warriors among them, and they acted like regular outlaws.
<npc=2112, part=4>
I didn't want to talk to them, but their chief showed me the Pennant of Death proving that they are on an official mission from the Necromancer Guild.
<npc=2112, part=5>
They, too, wanted to find the Astrologer, and I had to tell them how to find him: take the road up North and then turn right at the crossing.
<npc=2112, part=6>
I'm starting to worry about them now. I hope they don't hurt the Astrologer or Dina, his granddaughter. Maybe you can warn them?

Oh, you must have been sent to make sure that those people only do what they are supposed to!

What do you mean, "those people"?

Hey you, blockhead, come over here! Your mission: run back to the guys and bring me the gloves I left there. You've got ten minutes.
<npc=2107, iamfighter, iamfemale, part=1>
Hey you foxy thing, come over here! Your mission: run back to the guys and bring me the gloves I left there. You've got ten minutes.
<npc=2107, iammage, iammale, part=1>
Hey juggler, come over here! Your mission: run back to the guys and bring me the gloves I left there. And make it fast! 
<npc=2107, iammage, iamfemale, part=1>
Hey foxy! You, wearing the magical junk! Come over here. Your mission: run back to the guys and bring me the gloves I left there. And make it fast!
<npc=21, iamfighter, iammale, part=2>
Gloves? I seriously doubt that's going to happen. But I can certainly make arrangements for you to suffer a slow and painful death!
<npc=21, iamfighter, iamfemale, part=2>
You sure are making a lot of noise. Maybe you'll quiet down some after I cut your throat!
<npc=21, iammage, iammale, part=2>
It is a pleasure to meet you, young man. I have been worrying about the lack of combat practice that I am receiving, and you present an excellent opportunity to fix this problem.
<npc=21, iammage, iamfemale, part=2>
What a funny little man! I should devise a funny little death for him.
<npc=2107, part=3>
Watch your mouth! I am on an official mission from the Necromancer Guild, and you will obey me if you don't want to disappoint them!
<npc=21, iamfighter, iammale, part=4>
I don't care about your mission. You're going to get what you deserve...now!
<npc=21, iamfighter, iamfemale, part=4>
I don't give a crap what happens to the Guild. But you should be worried about what I'm going to do to you right now!
<npc=21, iammage, iammale, part=4>
I am sorry, but I am going to have to disappoint them. Now, I must terminate your life for your insolence and gall!
<npc=21, iammage, iamfemale, part=4>
The Guild is my problem. Your problem is now with me!

Hey noble, come over here! Your mission: run back to the guys and bring me the gloves I left there. You've got ten minutes.
<npc=22, part=2>
The mayor must have been talking about this lad when he described the gang. Well, it's not going to take very long to finish him off, at least!
<npc=2107, part=3>
Watch your mouth, scum! I am on an official mission from the Necromancer Guild, and you will obey me if you don't want to disappoint them!
<npc=22, part=4>
You are cowardly as well as insolent! You hide behind a powerful protector when it comes to taking responsibility. You will now be taught your final lesson!

<npc=22, part=1>
Hey, who are you and what are you doing here? Where are the owners of this house? I want to see the Astrologer.
<npc=694, part=2>
Oh, I'm so sorry! Unknown bandits have just killed the Astrologer. My brothers in the Guild are now interrogating his granddaughter, Dina. As for me, I am looking for evidence.
<Npc=22, part=3>
Unknown bandits? Weren't they seen in Ushut?
<npc=694, part=4>
Yes, they were.
<Npc=22, part=5>
Interesting! The mayor of Ushut tells me that their chief has the Pinnacle of Death. Then I meet the chief by the bridge, and he says that he is on a mission from the Necromancer Guild. What do you say to this?
<npc=694, part=6>
Hmmm...In this case, I'd recommend immediately proceeding to our camp down south and testify. Until you do so, you should keep this secret.
<Npc=22, part=7>
Why should I need to do that!? You're trying to set me up, aren't you? Why would you want me to keep silent otherwise?
<npc=694, part=8>
You are very keen, sir. But I will make sure that you do not share your speculations with anyone!

<npc=21, part=2>
Open your eyes, idiot! Can't you see the Pinnacle of Death in my hand?
<npc=21, iamfighter, iammale, part=3>
Your chief sent me to pick up the old man's papers. I hope you haven't used them for starting a fire or anything else. He would be very disappointed if you did.
<npc=21, iamfighter, iamfemale, part=3>
Shut your mouth, and it'll keep your teeth protected! Your chief sent me to pick up the old man's papers. I hope you haven't used them for starting a fire. He would be very disappointed if you did.
<npc=21, iammage, iammale, part=3>
You will shut your mouth in my presence! Your chief has ordered me to hand him the old man's papers. Now MOVE!
<npc=21, iammage, iamfemale, part=3>
Shut up now! Your chief has ordered me to hand him the old man's papers. Move now, or I'll wash you in a sea of fire!
<npc=2104, iammale, part=4>
Uh...I'm sorry, sir. Right away, sir! May I ask where is our chief and when he is coming here?
<npc=2104, iamfemale, part=4>
Uh...I'm sorry, ma'am. Right away, ma'am! May I ask where is our chief and when he is coming here?

I don't know exactly where he is, but I am sure that you will join him soon.

Don't be afraid, my girl! I will not hurt you, I want to help.
<npc=23, part=2>
How? Can you bring my grandpa back from the dead?
<npc=22, part=3>
All I can do for you is avenge his death. Those who commanded the assassins got what they deserved. But what did they want from you?
<npc=23, part=4>
The Necromancers wanted to find out what I know about my grandpa's observation of the falling of the Three Stars. It seemed very important to them!
<npc=22, part=5>
It is also important for me as well. Everything points at some dark mystery connected with the Fallen Stars, and it has to be solved. Trust me!
<npc=23, part=6>
The people who attacked our house took everything of value away. Grandpa's papers were among some other things.
<npc=23, part=7>
The bandits didn't think of telling the Necromancers about the papers, and I kept silent, as well. If you could only regain those papers!

I am sorry, but there is nothing I can do about that.
<npc=21, iammage, iammale, part=3 >
I am but a practicing mage rather than an omnipotent wizard. Unfortunately I cannot assist you with this request.

Then you may join me. My friend Igles and I have decided to discover where the Three Stars have fallen, and find them. Our quest is complicated and dangerous...

<npc=21, iammale, part=5>
I'm glad, partly because I can't read the papers I got from the bandits. The Astrologer was cautious, and he used secret symbols. Can you read any of this? Take a look!
